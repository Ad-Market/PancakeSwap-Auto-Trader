# PancakeSwap-Auto-Trader
A respository for autotrading on PancakeSwap V2 with MartinGale Strategy

## Disclaimer
We (me and [Danieleleo99](https://github.com/Danieleleo99)) **have modified** a project of [modagavr](https://github.com/modagavr), downloadable [here](https://github.com/modagavr/pancakeswap-prediction-winner).

**We do not assume any responsibility** for the use of this software, and even on potential capital loss.

## Functionalities
* This software chooses the same way as the original one, with the difference that it will try a **Martingale Strategy** on capital losses (untill the fourth loss).
* We also worked on stabilyzing win claims, that were done too fast with a loss of capital whenever PancakeSwap V2 had some slowdowns on calculating rewards per trade.

## To Do List
* As for now, were thinking on a way to trade using also some binary trading classic strategies, but with the upper changes we enstablished a very big improvement.
